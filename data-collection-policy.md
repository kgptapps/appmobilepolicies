# Data Collection Policy

**Last Updated:** July 5, 2025

## Overview

This Data Collection Policy outlines our approach to data handling for all experimental mobile applications developed by kgptapps.

## Minimal Data Collection Principle

We follow a principle of minimal data collection and maximum user privacy protection.

## Types of Data

### Data We DO NOT Collect
- Personal identification information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- Precise location data
- Contact lists or address books
- Photos, videos, or media files
- Financial or payment information
- Biometric data
- Health information
- Social media profiles or connections
- Device identifiers for tracking purposes

### Data We MAY Collect (Anonymous Only)
- Basic app usage statistics (anonymous)
- Crash reports (stripped of personal information)
- Performance metrics (anonymous)
- Error logs (sanitized)

## Data Processing

### Local Processing
- Most data processing occurs locally on your device
- We prefer local storage over cloud storage
- Data remains under your control

### Anonymous Analytics
- Any analytics data collected is anonymous and aggregated
- Cannot be traced back to individual users
- Used solely for improving app stability and performance

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
- User-generated data is stored locally on your device
- We do not maintain copies of your personal data
- You control deletion of local data

### No Cloud Storage
- We do not store personal user data in the cloud
- No user accounts or profiles are maintained
- No synchronization of personal data across devices

## Data Sharing

We DO NOT:
- Sell any data to third parties
- Share personal information with advertisers
- Provide data to data brokers
- Use data for marketing purposes
- Share data with social media platforms

## Third-Party Services

### App Store Analytics
- App stores may collect their own analytics
- We are not responsible for app store data collection
- Refer to your app store's privacy policy

### Crash Reporting Services
- May use anonymous crash reporting services
- Personal information is stripped from crash reports
- Used solely for debugging purposes

## User Rights

### Data Control
- You control all data on your device
- You can delete app data at any time
- No account deletion needed (no accounts exist)

### Transparency
- This policy describes all data practices
- No hidden data collection occurs
- Changes to this policy will be clearly communicated

## Data Security

### Limited Risk
- Minimal data collection reduces security risks
- Local storage reduces exposure
- No central database to be compromised

### Basic Security Measures
- Standard app security practices are followed
- However, we make no guarantees about security
- Use at your own risk

## Experimental Nature Impact

### Data Handling Risks
- Experimental apps may have data handling bugs
- Data loss or corruption is possible
- No guarantees about data integrity

### User Responsibility
- You are responsible for backing up important data
- We are not liable for any data-related issues
- Use these apps only with non-critical data

## Children's Data

- Our apps are not intended for children under 13
- We do not knowingly collect data from children
- Parents should supervise children's app usage

## Changes to This Policy

- This policy may be updated as our practices evolve
- Material changes will be communicated through app updates
- Continued use implies acceptance of changes

## No Liability for Data Issues

WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA-RELATED ISSUES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DATA LOSS, CORRUPTION, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, OR PRIVACY BREACHES.
